In this project I created a simple web browser using WebKit. 
The whole thing takes only about 60 lines of code once you remove comments and empty lines, which shows us how easy WebKit is to use.

loadView(), WKWebView, delegation, URL, URLRequest, UIToolbar, UIProgressView, KVO, and more in this app.
